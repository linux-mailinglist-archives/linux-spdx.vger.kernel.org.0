I have to wonder what the object is here: to get the problem fixed or
to make a public spectacle?

Because if the object had been to get the issue fixed, waiting a year
before escalating to the SCSI list isn't the best way to achieve
outcomes, nor is now demanding that the drivers be orphaned for lack of
response to you ... particularly as you've seen the drivers updated
over that time if you actually follow kernel releases.

Qlogic or now Marvell tends to rely somewhat heavily on outsourcing for
driver maintenance and support.  Outsourcers, fairly obviously, aren't
going to respond to legal issues like this which are outside of their
remit.  What needs to happen is that someone needs to find a person
within the Qlogic org who can get this fixed ... possibly involving
explaining the actual issue along the way.  Would you like us to use
our contacts to do that?

James
