And, to be honest, they were totally dumb attempts at doing things that
ended up not doing what they thought they were doing.

Both of these are find, but maybe you need to put:

somewhere in here instead?

That is correct, we shouldn't.

Maintainers should not do that, it is not their place to do so.  They
_can_ push back on, again, stupid things, but in the end, they should
accept anything that is a compatible license with the kernel as it is
really up to the copyright owner as to what license they wish to use.

So while I like the intent here, I don't think this wording change is
good as-is.

As it stands, the text makes sense, but as always, if you have legal
questions, you should be talking to a lawyer, not a kernel developer :)
