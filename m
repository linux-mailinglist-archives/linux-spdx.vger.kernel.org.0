So...this file *is* in UTF-8; I'm finding your changelog a bit
confusing.=20

It seems that what you're really doing is replacing "smart quotes" with
the basic ASCII variety?  That seems like a fine thing to do, but that's
not really what the changelog says.

I can tweak it when I apply this.

Meanwhile, though, if there's a bug it's the spdxcheck.py issue reported
by Rahul.  That problem doesn't reproduce here; he must be running in an
environment where ASCII is assumed.  Being explicit about the encoding
expected is the right fix in any case...  Maybe I'll snag that patch as
well if nobody else beats me to it.

Thanks,

jon
