Right. I'll fix it.

Yes:

	https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues/686
	https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues/970

In summary, GFDL can either be a free or non-free license, depending
on having or not "invariant sections", but SPDX spec is incomplete on
that matter.

=46rom the discussions, it *seems* that we'll end having a SPDX header
like:=20

	GFDL-1.2-or-later-no-invariant	https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/mi=
lestone/12


But the discussion is still open, and so far there's no such tag.
So, we'll need to keep track at the above issues, until they finally
create the new ones.

It sounds that this is expected to happen on SPDX version 3.10:

Btw, thanks for asking. I just added some comments there, in order
to indicate what it is needed for the Linux Kernel.

Thanks,
