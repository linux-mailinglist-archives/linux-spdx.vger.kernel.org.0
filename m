I agree it is something that deserves attention and careful thought, yes.
("really important" is relative and at this time of night, other things 
that have nothing to do with
licensing of software may be really important. like going to sleep! :)

*sigh* I am well aware that you are not a fan of SPDX (nor me, 
probably), but let's please not over-state this.
SPDX identifiers are used, have been used, and will continue to be used 
effectively for many open source project
as a way to express the license in a source file. Whether you like it or 
not! :)

As for non-standard disclaimers in a license notice - this is not a huge 
problem as it seems you are making it.
Let me put some numbers to that:
- of the ~400 (I've lost track) licenses currently on the SPDX License 
List, only about 46 of them even have a
standard license notice (defined in the SPDX License List as, "text 
intended to be put in the header of source
files or other files as specified in the license or license appendix 
when specifically delineated")
- of those approx 46, about 30 have some form of disclaimer type 
language (I was being generous here)
- of those 30:
- - 9 of them are GNU licenses (GPL - all 3 versions, LGPL - 2 versions, 
AGPL, and GFDL - all 3 versions)
- - then there's Apache-2.0
- - and the rest are old (e.g. SISSL, CPAL), rarely used, and/or 
entity-specific licenses (APSL, W3C).
So that's really only 10 licenses that are in use.

I have not seen this be an issue with Apache-2.0 and I doubt it's so 
much an issue with GFDL, so we are really only talking about this 
potentially being an issue with GPL and LGPL.

So, here we are - I suppose the Linux kernel is the appropriate place to 
have it come up, given that!

Whether this increases the risk or whether the stakes are considered 
high or not is all part of a risk assessment.
Assessing risk is not simply - could a bad thing happen, it's also looks 
at the likelihood of it happening and the impact, etc.

What would be helpful is if we (or I guess, really I) can try to ask 
lawyers versed in interpretation of these kinds of things and get some 
idea as to the scope of what changes we see here may or may not be 
likely to be consequential.

That is answering the second question before we've answered the first. 
In any case, your position is heard on this part! ;)
